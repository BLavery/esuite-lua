Project List:

01 Simplest GPIO control from Blynk
02 A PIR sends notification alert to Blynk
03 Control a RC Servo from Blynk
04 ADXL345 accelerometer pitch and roll to Blynk
05 HCsr04 sonar controlling tank pump, Blynk override
06 "Smart" button. Detect different press length
07 Telnet server - in 2 lines!
08 Repeat SNTP time sync attempts if failed initially
09 Digital gpio numbers expanded to D28 and analog to A7
10 Analog module PCF8591. Adds A8 to A11, and adc.write()
11 Deepsleep test by button
12 Deepsleep battery longevity test, recorded to ThingSpeak

If it has no number, it is not posted up yet:
