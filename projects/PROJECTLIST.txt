Project List:

01 Simplest GPIO control from Blynk
02 A PIR sends notification alert to Blynk
03 Control a RC Servo from Blynk
04 ADXL345 accelerometer pitch and roll to Blynk
05 HCsr04 sonar controlling tank pump, Blynk override
06 "Smart" button. Detect different press length
07 Telnet server - in 2 lines!
08 Repeat SNTP time sync attempts if failed initially
09 Digital gpio numbers expanded to D28 and analog to A7
10 Analog module PCF8591. Adds read A8 to A11, and adc.write()
11 Deepsleep test by button
12 Deepsleep battery longevity test, recorded to ThingSpeak
13 Stepper motor unipolar
14 GPS widget on smartphone. ESP shows distance & bearing (blynk)
15 Accel widget on phone. ESP shows pitch/roll (blynk)
16 MQTT demo. Publish to MQTT topics, and subscribe to topics.
19 Tone generator for passive beeper
20 ESP-01. MQTT & Thingspeak & DHT22 weather & logger & telnet combo!

If it has no number, it is not posted up yet:

   Blynk with mini-telnet ("TNET") in app terminal  
   Logging to Thingspeak
   Local Data logger in flash file
   Webserver with gpio controls
   Webserver with logger readout
   Webserver controls for servo, accelerometer, etc
   Webserver. Sonar controlling tank pump, override from browser
   Webserver offering TNET
